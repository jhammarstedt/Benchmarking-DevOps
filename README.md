## Task
This project was aimed to teach others how to set up a Github Action to create continuous benchmarking with pytest. We also added a simple visualization with Github Pages that we walk through briefly in the tutorial. 

This will help developers easily compare benchmark results and alert on worse performance when making new commits. The statistics from the latest run are found in `output.json` and the historical comparison table is visualized in the generated page available [here](https://jhammarstedt.github.io/Benchmarking-DevOps/).

## Katacoda tutorial (Scheduled to be complete the latest on 30/4/2020)
We have created a katacoda tutorial that runs a bash terminal and a VS code environment in the browser. It walks through every step to build and set up this repo yourself. 

You will learn how to: 
* Create simple Github Action that will let you test and compare python scripts on pushes to your GitHub repository
    * With a few modifications, you can also implement them for other tasks to enable CI/CD in your other projects!
    * You can also use this action with similar performance tools for other programming languages.
* Create your first Github Page that will display the results from your testing

It will soon be published here.

## Description and usage (If you're not planning on doing the tutorial)
To try this project out simply fork this repository and create a commit. 

```
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/jhammarstedt/Benchmarking-DevOps.git
$ cd Benchmarking-DevOps
# Clear the table
$ chmod +x ./scripts/clear_table.sh
$ ./scripts/clear_table.sh
```
Make a change to a file and push it to the repo.

Ideally, you would change the [benchmarking.py script](https://github.com/jhammarstedt/Benchmarking-DevOps/blob/master/src/benchmarking.py) since that will give different performance results. We have 2 test functions, a slower `turtle` and faster `cheetah` which are just used to test the benchmarking. So try to change:

```
line 22: benchmark(turtle) --> benchmark(cheetah)
```
Commit this, get some results, and then change back and commit again to see the difference. 


* The workflow file is found in [`.github/workflows/python.yml`](https://github.com/jhammarstedt/Benchmarking-DevOps/tree/master/.github/workflows)
* The configurations for the webpage is found in [docs](https://github.com/jhammarstedt/Benchmarking-DevOps/tree/master/docs)
* All python scripts are found in [`src`](https://github.com/jhammarstedt/Benchmarking-DevOps/tree/master/src)


### Enable Github Pages 
1. Go to settings for your cloned repository
2. Find pages (almost all the way down to the left)
3. The source should be `master` and also specify `/docs` as there is an HTML file running it.
4. Press the link generated (might take up to 30 sec after enabling it)

### Clean the table in Gh Pages

If you want to reset the table again  simply run
```$ ./scripts/clear_table.sh```

    The author of the action did not support memes by repo owners, which would be a problem for our purpose. So I raised that
   <a href="https://clipart.world/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Colorful-Easter-Egg-clipart-transparent.png" target="_top">issue</a> and got a new feature merged for this tutorial ðŸ¤™

## Future work
* Add support for more languages
